# PostgreSQL as a MySQL User

For the entirety of my career i've been a developer who always used MySQL. Not nessecarily for its features or performance but I believe mainly because i've been a PHP developer. PHP generally seems to be coupled with MySQL atleast for most of the tutorials, articles, and frameworks i've used. Also it was pretty easy to setup a LAMP stack, or easy to find a service that already had these services.

After working with Ruby on Rails for a few months; the team i'm on has decided to switch to PostgreSQL in favor of MySQL. 

Now i'm happily challenged with understanding how PostgreSQL differs from MySQL. A few challenges I have already faced with is the differences with setting up a server, creating a database, and exploring the server and databases via command line. 

Since were using Ruby on Rails and the server wil lbe hosted by Google; I believe that most of the heavy lifting will be taken care of.

Today we dealt with roles and permissions.
