# Inconsistent Password Security Policies

One of the most frustrating thing about using multiple services is the fact that each service has its own password policy. And even more frustrating when a password policy actually forces me to choose a even less secure password.

If only more services would use a standard such as [NIST.SP.800-63b](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63b.pdf) to configure a password policy.
